      <div class="container">
         <h1>Applying Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Recover, Repair</h1>
         <div class="sprite five-r" title="Courtesy:"></div>
         <p>Students can help minimize waste by practicing 5Rs. For example, students can carry reusable 
         water bottles and lunchboxes to reduce single-use plastics. Recycling paper can save trees 
         which are harmful to the environment. Students can also encourage friends and family to have 
         these habits to strengthen the impact.
         </p>

  <div class="container">
      <h1>Conserve Energy</h1>
      <div class="sprite2 switch" title="Courtesy:"></div>
      <p>Turning off lights and unplugging devices in the classroom when not in use can lower energy 
         consumption. Schools can also adopt energy-efficient practices, like using solar panels. 
         Encouraging classmates to report unnecessary energy usage also encourages accountability.
      </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="container">
      <h1>Plant Trees and Green Spaces</h1>
      <div class="sprite2 garden"></div>
      <p>Tree planting helps absorb CO2 and improves air quality. Students can organize tree-planting 
         events in their communities or school grounds. Caring for plants in small gardens in school 
         can also teach sustainability. A greener environment benefits not only the planet but also 
         mental health by providing relaxing spaces.
      </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="container">
      <h1>Raise Awareness Through Social Media</h1>
      <div class="sprite2 socmed" title="Courtesy:"></div>
      <p>Social media is a powerful tool for spreading awareness about climate issues. Students 
         can use this to raise awareness about climate change and highlight eco-friendly tips. 
      </p>

  <div class="container">
      <h1>Join Environmental Clubs</h1>
      <div class="sprite2 treeplant"></div>
      <p>An environmental club can be a great organization students can join if they are passionate 
         about climate issues and have a desire to save the environment. </p>
